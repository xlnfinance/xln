# NOT ACTIVE: Multi-Agent Protocol Extension Notes

Status: inactive reference document.

Do not use this as active workflow.
Use `agents/workflow.md` as the canonical protocol.

## Why Inactive
- Too large and high-overhead for daily execution.
- Includes optional economy and verbose papertrail policies.
- Not fully tool-enforced.

## Useful Ideas Preserved in Active Protocol
- Human shortcuts: `y/n/?/!/1-9`
- Optional queue/inbox mode
- Atomic task claim pattern
- Emergency stop behavior

## Future Extension Candidates
- Task queue schemas (`queue/task-*.md`)
- Lightweight status snapshots per agent
- Optional remote sync hooks
- Optional voting records for major merges
