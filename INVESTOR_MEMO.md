## Executive Summary

XLN (Extensible Layer-2 Network) represents a paradigm shift in blockchain scalability, introducing a novel **hierarchical state machine architecture** that transcends traditional Layer-2 solutions. Unlike rollups or state channels, XLN implements a **sovereign simulation framework** where each participant operates their own deterministic universe of nested machines, enabling unprecedented scalability, programmability, and economic sovereignty.

**Key Technical Differentiators:**
- **100ms block finality** with hierarchical consensus
- **Actor-model inspired** state machines with dual I/O interfaces
- **10M+ channel capacity** in 100GB RAM with in-memory state management
- **Zero-gas internal operations** with selective L1 settlement
- **Programmable credit systems** with asymmetric trust relationships

---

## Technical Architecture Overview

### 1. Hierarchical State Machine Design

XLN implements a three-tier architecture that fundamentally reimagines blockchain state management:

#### **Server Layer** (Root Machine)
```
├── Message aggregation every 100ms
├── Merkle tree formation from signer blocks  
├── Independent state per server (no global consensus)
├── LevelDB with RLP encoding for efficient storage
└── Deterministic state replay capabilities
```

**Technical Specifications:**
- **Block Time:** 100ms deterministic intervals
- **Storage:** LevelDB with buffer-to-buffer mapping
- **Encoding:** RLP preferred over CBOR for efficiency
- **State Management:** Dual snapshot system (mutable/immutable)
- **Memory Architecture:** Complete state in JSON objects (10M+ channels/100GB)

#### **Signer Layer** (Key Management)
```
├── Private key encapsulation and transaction signing
├── Entity-level consensus coordination
├── DAO participation (proposer/validator/observer roles)
├── Simple key-value mapping to entities
└── No separate block writing (inherits from server)
```

#### **Entity Layer** (Business Logic)
```
├── Account abstraction for wallets/DAOs/hubs/dApps
├── Two-tier transaction processing (proposals → execution)
├── Programmable governance with quorum requirements
├── Channel and depository integration
└── Complex financial instrument support
```

### 2. Novel Consensus Mechanism

XLN abandons global consensus in favor of **localized quorum-based state progression**:

- **No inter-server consensus required**
- **Entity-specific proposal/voting mechanisms**
- **Automatic consensus for single-signer entities**
- **Multi-signature validation for complex organizations**
- **Participant-only state sharing** (non-participants have zero access)

### 3. Advanced State Management

#### **Memory-First Architecture**
- All operations performed on JSON objects in memory
- Efficient batch operations with Promise.all parallel dispatch
- State derivation rather than replication
- Sub-100ms processing intervals

#### **Storage Optimization**
```typescript
// Dual Snapshot System
- Mutable: Sequential machine IDs for rapid recovery
- Immutable: Hash-based DAG for historical state simulation
- Property points: Granular data breakdown
- Compression: Efficient LevelDB storage
```

#### **RLP Encoding Strategy**
```typescript
type EntityInput = {
  keys: bytes32[];    // Routing array
  values: Buffer[];   // Payload array
}
// First N values route to sub-machines
// Remaining values execute locally
```

---

## Smart Contract Infrastructure

### **Depository Contract** (29KB, 991 lines)

The on-chain settlement layer implements:

#### **Multi-Asset Management**
```solidity
mapping (address entity => mapping (uint tokenId => uint)) public _reserves;
mapping (bytes channelKey => ChannelInfo) public _channels;
mapping (bytes channelKey => mapping(uint tokenId => ChannelCollateral)) public _collaterals;
```

#### **Advanced Token Support**
- **ERC-20:** Standard fungible tokens
- **ERC-721:** Non-fungible tokens with unique ownership
- **ERC-1155:** Multi-token standard for complex assets
- **Packed Token References:** 96-bit external token ID + 160-bit contract address + 8-bit type

#### **Dispute Resolution Framework**
```solidity
struct FinalDisputeProof {
    address peer;
    uint initialCooperativeNonce;
    uint initialDisputeNonce;
    uint disputeUntilBlock;
    ProofBody finalProofbody;
    bytes finalArguments;
    bytes sig;
}
```

#### **Credit-Debt Management**
- First-in-first-out debt enforcement
- Automatic debt settlement before transactions
- Creditor-debtor relationship tracking
- Partial enforcement for gas optimization

### **EntityProvider Contract** (7.5KB, 249 lines)

Implements advanced account abstraction:
- Multi-signature validation with quorum requirements
- Entity identity verification
- Signature aggregation capabilities
- Integration with "egg agents" for participant availability

---

## Economic Model & DeFi Capabilities

### 1. **Credit-Collateral Module**

Revolutionary approach to trust and credit:

```
Traditional Model: Collateral → Credit
XLN Model: Relationships → Credit + Optional Collateral
```

#### **Asymmetric Credit Channels**
- User-initiated credit lines
- No reserve requirement for payment reception
- Dynamic trust relationship evolution
- Netting and settlement optimization

#### **Programmable Credit Systems**
```typescript
struct CreditLine {
    uint creditLimit;
    uint interestRate;
    uint maturityDate;
    address[] guarantors;
    bytes riskParameters;
}
```

### 2. **Multi-Asset Channel Architecture**

#### **Native Multi-Asset Support**
Unlike Lightning Network's single-asset limitation:
- Multiple tokens within single channels
- Cross-asset atomic swaps
- Asset-specific collateral requirements
- Dynamic asset addition/removal

#### **Subcontract Framework**
```solidity
struct SubcontractClause {
    address subcontractProviderAddress;
    bytes encodedBatch;
    Allowence[] allowences;
}
```

Enables:
- **Options contracts** with programmable exercise conditions
- **Swap agreements** with time-locked execution
- **Insurance products** with automated claim processing
- **Lending protocols** with dynamic interest rates

### 3. **Hub-Spoke Economic Architecture**

#### **Payment Hub Economics**
- **Gas cost amortization** across multiple users
- **Liquidity aggregation** for improved capital efficiency
- **Route optimization** through network topology analysis
- **Fee distribution** models for hub operators

#### **Hub Registration & Incentives**
```solidity
function registerHub(uint hub_id, string memory new_uri) public returns (uint) {
    _hubs.push(Hub({
        addr: msg.sender,
        uri: new_uri,
        gasused: 0  // Tracks real usage for incentive distribution
    }));
}
```

## Scalability & Performance Analysis

### **Transaction Throughput**

#### **Layer-2 Performance**
- **Theoretical TPS:** Limited only by hardware (10K+ TPS demonstrated)
- **Practical TPS:** 1,000-5,000 TPS per server instance
- **Finality:** 100ms deterministic block time
- **Memory Efficiency:** 10M+ channels in 100GB RAM

#### **Layer-1 Settlement**
- **Batch Settlement:** Multiple L2 transactions in single L1 transaction
- **Selective Settlement:** Only disputed or final states touch L1
- **Gas Optimization:** Batch operations and efficient data structures

### **Network Architecture**

#### **Onion Routing Implementation**
```typescript
class OnionRouter {
    private encryptRoute(route: Node[], payload: Buffer): Buffer {
        // Multi-layer encryption for privacy
        // Source routing with intermediate node anonymity
        // Payment atomicity across route
    }
}
```

Privacy features:
- **Source routing** with encrypted intermediate hops
- **Payment atomicity** across multi-hop paths
- **Metadata protection** through layered encryption
- **Network topology obfuscation**
