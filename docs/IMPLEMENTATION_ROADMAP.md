# XLN Implementation Roadmap

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- **Entity Consensus**: Byzantine fault tolerant consensus with single-signer optimization
- **Account Consensus**: Bilateral state machines with ondelta/offdelta tracking
- **Delta Mechanics**: Three-zone capacity model (credit/collateral/peer)
- **Entity Routing**: Fixed - dynamically finds target entity signers
- **J-Event Processing**: Blockchain event bubbling to entities
- **Hanko Signatures**: Hierarchical approval chains

### üèóÔ∏è Built but Not Integrated
- **Entity Channels** (`entity-channel.ts`): Complete P2P channel infrastructure exists but unused
- **J-Machine** (`j-machine.ts`): Blockchain watcher built but not connected to main loop
- **Channel Manager**: Bilateral channels ready but messages still route through server

### ‚ùå Missing Components
- **P2P Networking**: Currently simulated in-memory
- **Real Blockchain Integration**: Using mock j-events
- **Dispute Resolution**: Path exists but not implemented
- **Credit Limits**: Structure exists but not enforced

## Integration Priority

### Phase 1: Activate Existing Infrastructure (Week 1)
**Goal**: Use what's already built

1. **Connect EntityChannelManager**
   ```typescript
   // In server.ts, replace global routing with:
   entityChannelManager.sendMessage(fromEntityId, toEntityId, signerId, txs)
   ```

2. **Wire J-Machine to Server Loop**
   ```typescript
   // In server.ts tick():
   const jEvents = await jMachine.pollBlockchain();
   const entityInputs = jMachine.createEntityInputsFromEvents(jEvents);
   ```

3. **Enable Channel-Based Routing**
   - Modify `applyEntityInput` to check channel status first
   - Route through bilateral channels instead of global mempool

### Phase 2: Complete Account Layer (Week 2)
**Goal**: Full bilateral consensus

1. **Implement Credit Enforcement**
   - Add credit limit checks in `processAccountTx`
   - Implement allowance mechanics
   - Add global USD credit limits

2. **Add Missing Account Operations**
   - Channel rebalancing
   - Credit line adjustments
   - Subcontract execution

3. **Complete Frame Consensus**
   - Implement rollback mechanism
   - Add frame verification
   - Enable cooperative settlement

### Phase 3: Blockchain Integration (Week 3)
**Goal**: Connect to real contracts

1. **Deploy Contracts**
   - EntityProvider.sol (already exists)
   - Depository.sol (already exists)
   - Deploy to local testnet

2. **Implement J-Event Watcher**
   - Connect to Ethereum RPC
   - Parse EntityRegistered events
   - Parse ReserveDeposited events

3. **Enable On-Chain Settlement**
   - Implement dispute submission
   - Add proof generation
   - Enable channel closing

### Phase 4: P2P Networking (Week 4)
**Goal**: True decentralization

1. **Replace In-Memory Simulation**
   - Add libp2p or similar
   - Implement peer discovery
   - Enable direct entity communication

2. **Message Authentication**
   - Add signature verification
   - Implement replay protection
   - Add rate limiting

3. **Network Resilience**
   - Handle disconnections
   - Implement message retry
   - Add channel recovery

## Technical Debt to Address

### Immediate
1. Remove hardcoded test values
2. Add proper error handling
3. Implement transaction validation

### Short-term
1. Add comprehensive logging
2. Implement state persistence
3. Add metrics collection

### Long-term
1. Optimize message serialization
2. Implement state pruning
3. Add horizontal sharding

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Delta calculations
- Frame consensus
- Channel operations

### Integration Tests
- J‚ÜíE‚ÜíA flow (exists, needs expansion)
- Multi-entity consensus
- Dispute resolution

### Load Tests
- 1000+ entities
- 10,000+ channels
- Million TPS locally

## Success Metrics

### Week 1
- Entity channels routing messages
- J-Machine processing real events
- All tests passing

### Week 2
- Full account consensus working
- Credit limits enforced
- Frame verification complete

### Week 3
- Connected to blockchain
- On-chain settlement working
- Dispute resolution tested

### Week 4
- P2P networking active
- True decentralization achieved
- Production-ready system

## Key Insight

The architecture is already correct. The components exist. They just need to be connected. This isn't building new - it's activating what's dormant.

The gaps between components aren't failures - they prove the sovereignty. Each layer CAN work independently because it IS independent. Integration is just letting them communicate, not coupling them.

## Next Immediate Step

```bash
# Run the clean test to verify current state
bun src/test-j-e-a-clean.ts

# Then start connecting EntityChannelManager
# The infrastructure is waiting to be activated
```

The system wants to be complete. The architecture knows what it needs. Follow the structure that already exists.
