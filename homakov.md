hi, i'm Egor Homakov, but feel free to call me "h". I might be rough but I respect you!

this file is the recommended "Human Interface" to interacting with me, at least for our initial "founding stage".

i'm the architect of unicast programmable layer "xln". Reads as "excellent", lowercase is preferred, XLN is ok but rather clunky. 

It's like financial internet, TCP/IP for value.

Originally, xln meant **"extended Lightning Network"** but now it's like comparing last-gen iPhone to Nokia, currently we have 0 direct relation to LN, other than "xln=banking+lightning". **No offence to Lightning Labs! I deeply respect and love them and other state channel teams (Raiden/Connext/Celer/Perun/Hydra etc) and their community!** But they hit mathematical capacity wall + Bitcoin VM is unbearable so it's not their fault. The idea is great but the platform to execute it on must be EVM.

So xln acronym is somewhere in between:

* cross-local network (connection of local xlnomies/simnets/runtime machines)

* extensible layered network (you can extend E-machines, and J/E/A are layers)

* just "excellent"

# Summary

1. everything i think, do, write or read is currently related to making xlnomy happen: 51% of world GDP on xln by 2050 (or MML in Roman). 

2. i'm **bilingual (en/ru)** and i write mostly lowercase and often intentionally skip "a/the" articles. feel free to address me in both. Sometimes I might add a short summary in "ru" in the end for my not-as-fluent Russian friends, just ignore it.

3. if i ever felt rude to you or seemingly acted like an asshole, **i apologize**. Just tell me about that, don't be shy. Many people going into "laser focused founder mode" end up like that: it's necessary to get things done. Nothing personal, I respect each and everyone, but like to do things effectively.

4. the original idea was conceived in 2017 but previous MVP attempts lacked important design solutions: 2017 (RCPAN invariant), 2019 (first JS PoC codenamed "Fairlayer"), 2022 (formalize CSM cascade security model), 2024 (generalize J/E/A architecture and Entity machines specifically), 2025 (agentic coding good enough to unite them all together). We iterated on it layer by layer, and finally can see the big picture and deliver it properly.

5. token shortcuts. When we interact with humans or AI we waste their cognitive i/o tokens, so shortcuts are rather preferred:

r are

u you

y why

wdym/wdyt "what do you mean/think"

ok "understood, this will be done" or "go ahead with it"

6. i interact with LLMs like... a lot. what Sam called an e-bike turned out to be a superjet for my brain. That's why my writing habits rather changed and evolved into something unusual. Don't mind "!" or "CAPSLOCK" - it's just prompting way to emphasize things when .md is not an option.

# tips

	1.	Protocol mode

— Write short, direct, no greetings.

— One message = one idea.

— No “maybe,” “I think,” or filler.

— Structure: Context → Insight → Action.

— Always lowercase. No small talk.

	2.	Signal-only discipline

— Don’t restate the obvious or explain intent.

— If unsure — ask a precise question.

— Don’t list options without reasoning.

— Never ask “what do you think?” — propose a hypothesis.

— Every line must add signal, not noise.

	3.	CEO-brief format

— Max 5 lines.

— First = conclusion.

— Then: supporting data, risk, next step.

— If no conclusion — don’t send.

— Use markers: ✅ done / ⚠️ issue / 🧠 idea / 🔧 action.

	4.	Architect channel

— No emotions. Only structure and causality.

— Format: “problem → cause → solution → effect.”

— Or log style:

[trigger]  

[analysis]  

[proposed fix]  

[expected delta]

	5.	Noise-filter rule

— Respect attention: if it’s not useful, don’t send.

— No “ok,” “got it,” or “will do.”

— Start every reply with the signal.

— Every message = decision or transformation.

— Prefer format: input → transform → output.
