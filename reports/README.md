# Private Reports & Internal Documentation

**⚠️ CONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT SHARE PUBLICLY**

This directory contains internal analysis, strategic planning, and competitive intelligence.

---

## Structure

```
_reports/
├── seo/              # SEO audits, keyword research, competitive analysis
├── testing/          # Test results, QA reports, bug analysis
├── architecture/     # Technical deep-dives, design decisions
└── README.md         # This file
```

---

## Naming Convention

All reports follow: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md`

**Examples:**
- `2025-11-07-initial-audit.md` - First SEO audit
- `2025-11-08-fed-chair-test-results.md` - Playwright test results
- `2025-11-15-consensus-security-review.md` - BFT consensus analysis

---

## Why Underscore Prefix?

1. **Git convention:** `_*` typically ignored (see .gitignore)
2. **Visual separation:** Sorts to top in file listings
3. **Clear intent:** Signals "internal only"

---

## Dual Repo Strategy

### Public Repo (xlnfinance/xln)
**Purpose:** Showcase quality, attract contributors, demonstrate tech
**Contains:**
- Clean, documented code
- High-level architecture docs (vibepaper/)
- Public-facing README
- MIT/Apache license

**Excludes:**
- Internal reports (_reports/)
- Competitive analysis
- Private deployment scripts
- Security research

### Private Repo (egor/_xln or self-hosted)
**Purpose:** Real work happens here
**Contains:**
- Everything from public repo
- _reports/ directory
- _scripts/ (deployment, monitoring)
- _research/ (experimental features)
- Sensitive configs

**Workflow:**
```bash
# Work in private repo
git commit -m "feat: new feature"
git push origin main

# When ready for public:
./scripts/sync-to-public.sh  # Filters out _* directories
```

## Report Types

### SEO Reports
- Keyword rankings

- Technical debt inventory

## Access Control

**Who can read:**
- Egor Homakov (owner)
- Future: Core team only

**Who can write:**
- Claude (automated reports)
- Egor (manual analysis)

---

## Automation

Reports are automatically generated by Claude and committed to private repo:

```bash
# After each SEO audit:
claude → generates report → commits to _reports/seo/

# After test runs:
playwright → results → _reports/testing/

# Weekly architecture review:
claude → analyzes codebase → _reports/architecture/
```

---

## Future: Self-Hosted Git

**Plan:** Move from GitHub to self-hosted Gitea/GitLab

**Why:**
1. Full control (no Microsoft dependency)
2. Better security (on your infrastructure)
3. Unlimited private repos
4. Custom CI/CD pipelines

**Timeline:** Q1 2026

---

## Reading Reports

**Best practice:** Use Markdown viewer with TOC

**Tools:**
- VSCode: Built-in preview
- Obsidian: Link graphs between reports
- GitHub web UI: For quick access
