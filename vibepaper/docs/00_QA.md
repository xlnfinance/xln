## whoami

I am Egor Homakov, security researcher and architect of UFT/Xln. Lets briefly elaborate my **intrinsic motivation and passion** to creating this protocol. 

I started my career in Ruby on Rails/JavaScript software engineering circa 2007. In 2012, I've stumbled upon a fundamental insecure-by-default pattern in Rails called mass assignment and inappropriately hacked Github to [make my point](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/b83965785db1eec019edf1fc272b1aa393e6dc57). Ever since I've been obsessed with finding not just one-off bugs, but systemic flaws in protocols and improving software layers as a whole: further hardening Ruby-ecosystem, client side security, OAuth2, proposed [SecureLogin](https://github.com/sakurity/securelogin/) (would be way more convenient than passkeys if adopted by big tech).

Then I founded [Sakurity](https://sakurity.com), conducted boutique security audits and pentests for some of the big names in the startup industry. Things went good. Around 2017 I've retired from consulting and focused on **the most critical yet most vulnerable and misdesigned architecture on the planet** – our financial system, as a whole. This includes both TradFi + DeFi, as per JEA mental model soon you will see they are the same.

The catalyst was reading the Lightning Network whitepaper and realizing: the authors (Joseph Poon, Thaddeus Dryja) invented the genius primitives, **"the wheel"** (proofs + collateral + delta transformer) but then tried to apply it in a delusional way, **"the unicycle"** (full-reserve account network, has no working incentive model, can't scale). Yes, unicycle can work under rare conditions, but do you see people using it on the street?

I voiced my concerns in 2017 and it was discared as FUD. In 2025 it's crystal clear I was right: Lightning/Raiden/Hydra and all other full-reserve inspired channel designs are dead due to inbound capacity problem.

The solution to inbound capacity was painfully obvious to me: **credit is all you need**. This is when the core of Xln was formed: molding together the most scalable & universally understood Unicast full-credit architecture (custodial/banking/CEX network of accounts) with the most secure but unusable Layer2 technology (full-reserve payment/state channels). The RCPAN invariant `−Lₗ ≤ Δ ≤ C + Lᵣ` was born on Aug 24, 2017. This is the core formula, around of which further layers are built upon.

The Unified Financial Theory and Xln (practical reference implementation) is my magnum opus and quintessence of 9 years of research into TradFi/RTGS/DeFi/DAO/AA/institutional governance/state channels. I believe UFT/Xln is 100x more important than all of my infosec research combined. Call me delusional, but I just happen to be right, eventually.

## Another Bitcoin/Ethereum Killer?

**No, quite the opposite! Xln is not a "blockchain" at all or as we call it, Jurisdiction machine. 

Simply put, Xln is a unified netting Layer2 for all jurisdictional gross layers (J-machines) out there. Including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Including Fedwire and ECB and other central banks, once they realize the inevitability of what's coming.**

I love Bitcoin for its legacy. I love Ethereum for bringing generalized programmability to J-machines. But currently they are trying to solve the wrong problem.

J-machine **is not what should be scaled**. Leave it alone - it's doing perfectly fine at 30-100 tps globally. It's not meant for coffee-payments. The organisational & transactional entity-account layer2, is what needs to be expanded, same as commercial banking layer operates underneath central banks/RTGS (e.g Fed+Fedwire = TradFi J-machine).

I am the most maxi full-node-on-every-device you can think of. Unfortunatelly, up until creation of Xln no blockchain could survive with ultra-lightweight L1 J-machine alone.

I religiously believe and double down on the original vision of Bitcoin and Ethereum where every laptop and phone can run fully verifying node. Xln is the first architecture that actually delivers that vision. 

Xln achieves that by creating two loosely coupled layers: J-REA 

* **Gross-J-Layer1 for >$1M transfers**: <30-100 tps global settlement  (Bitcoin and Ethereum are J-machines). Xln is jurisdiction-agnostic and can support any L1, but the lower global tps - the easier it is to run a full node on consumer device. Xln is the first architecture that works just fine with Original Ethereum, even if gaslimit is reduced 10-100x. Unlike rollups, Xln does not require blobspace or data availability committees of any form - the account proofs are sovereign and exits are guaranteed at all times.

* **Net-REA-Layer2 for <$1M transfers>**: unbounded scalability Unicast O(1). Xln is a netting overlay attaching to any EVM L1/EVM-rollup/future EVM-like CBDC J-machines, creating financial Internet of unified liquidity.

## The system uses credit. Credit = bad. #DontTrustVerify #BitcoinMAXI

I hate to break it to you, but every financial system under the sun uses some form of credit one way or another. It's just named differently. It's a different cascade of trust assumptions, projected over different threat models.

Take a single 1 BTC UTXO on-chain for example. **As of now, this is the safest way to store value on the planet.** 

Yet, even BTC can fall apart overnight. Several G7 security agencies can cooperate to attack mining pools. Deposit few Billions to thousands of warm KYC-d accounts in popular centralized exchanges around the world, swap it to any other non-BTC or fiat, then cancel (double-spend) their original BTC deposits to the exchanges. Whoops, $4T crypto economy would vanish overnight. 

Mission: Very-Much-Possible I must say. Luckily, most government officials are well invested into BTC and other neo J-machines. This is what keeps us safe, for now.

BTC-UTXO is golden standard and benchmark security, yes. Everything else is significantly worse that. 

Everyone else is trying to scale Broadcast O(n) J-machine but inevitably ends up with credit and counterparty risk one way or another.

## Big-blockers don't have credit. Solana/Tron/etc is the next big thing.

Solana is a Broadcast O(n) big-blocker, like almost everyone else. They have fantastic marketing and PR. They did a politically right thing to do. But it is not "scaling". 

**Big-blocker** is a catch-all term for anything that you cannot realistically run on a laptop or a phone, simple as that.

Yes, Solana uses fancy Proof-of-History (basically a streaming hashonion), but it has no impact on actual security assumtions. It runs in parallel, but that's a 10x improvement, not 1Mx one we need for planetery scalability. It requires unicast second layer.

## Rollups don't use credit

No, they all do. First, in form of preconfirmations - it's a fractional reserve-style promise given by sequenceer only covered by shared-pot bond. Second, in form of verifier dilemma and data availability paradox. Both are unsolvable.

## Payment channels don't use credit

Yes, and full-reserve channels don't work. And when they work, turns out custodial service or 0-conf/JIT on receive channel was used. Both are just weaker form of Xln's enforceable credit.

## You hate rollups? You hate payment channels?

No. I admire dedication. And that's why I admire both rollups and traditional full-reserve payment channels in their pursuit. 

But sometimes a simpler solution is out there, in front of your nose. It's not giving up, it's getting real.

## You are re-creating banks. Satoshi said we must get rid of those?

<img src="../frontend/static/img/bailout.png" width="600px">

Hubs (banks+brokers entities) were never the problem per se. Bailouts are. 

Hubs in tradfi lack 1) proofs for security-of-communication 2) collateral for security-from-counterparty-risk 3) delta transformers for security-in-motion.

Xlnomy is a bailout free. You never have a too-big-to-fail player, systemic contagion is bounded by per-link credit limits and escrowed collateral. 

## Show, don't tell!

You can build & play with your personal home-grown xlnomy at [xln.finance](https://xln.finance) in 2D/Graph 3D/VR/Panel/Terminal interface. **It's real fun with Oculus Quest!** Create personal entities, N/M multifactor entities, hierarchical companies and institutions with instant IPO of C/D shares with any hub. Stream dividends and buybacks per-second, do merge&acquisitions, new board election, and of course borrow/lend/payments/swaps and other DeFi primitives of any complexity.

## Should I read it? What's the target audience?

Anyone, really. Especially if you're into fintech/crypto/complex systems. If you're willing to bend your mental models around the status quo, embrace our contrarian yet factually correct rhetoric, ready to research into unknown and question the dogmas from first principles - yes.

If you don't have time for 30-60 min deep reading - **spend 5 minutes on understanding core RCPAN invariant** and save the rest of the document for the future. 

## How to read it

The documents are a little heavy on technical & financial terminology. This is intentional - instead of making it a tedious long read "for the general crowd", it seemed like a better idea to make it concentrated and to the point, letting readers ask an LLM of their choice to re-hydrate and expand on any paragraph, with targeted prompts like "ELI5?", "I'm a banker, what is it?", "I'm a protocols engineer, what's under the hood?".

There will be more approachable and elaborated versions of it soon. You're welcome to create your own adaptaion, though!

**Start with "context: https://xln.finance/c.txt should I learn it and why?" with any frontier language model.** GPT-5/Claude/Grok/Gemini/Qwen/GLM – all have phenomenal grasp on UFT/Xln once you attach the whitepapers/contracts/src as the context.s

Feel free to reach out directly if after 3-5 prompts the answers still seem cryptic to you.
